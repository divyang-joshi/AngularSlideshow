# AngularSlideshow

*Some Notes:*

1. The initial goal was to create a derivative. However, becuase of school and exams, I didn't stay up to date with Angulur updates on derivatives, so decided that would be my next step to truly make this a plugin. Essentially the way it would work is: 
  
  Place in the html file `<slideshow data='data' options='options'></slideshow>` and that would automatically expand to whatever is needed. 

2. The options can be modified, hence you can see how to easily change the 10second requirement to for example 3 seconds.
3. I started off with using promises in case the data was retrived asynchronously. However because of reason 1, I decided not to make the code more complex till the derivative is complete.
4. Options was initially designed for the derivative. But can still be used. What I have are the only options for now. There are many more things to add, like pause on hover, whether stopping resets the counter, etc. 
5. Total time taken to complete this was about 4 hours 30min. Most time went into trying to recall derivatives and trying to convert my controller code into a derivative.
